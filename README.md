# tornadoScraper

`tornadoScraper` is a program designed to gather substantial amounts of Doppler radar velocity data, particularly during tornadic events. The primary purpose is to visualize this data, which will later be used for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in another project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tornadoScraper.git\
cd tornadoScraper


2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
Using a virtual environment is recommended to keep project dependencies isolated.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


3. **Install Dependencies**:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. (If applicable) **Configuration**:
Describe any required configuration, like API keys, database setup, environment variables, etc.

5. (If applicable) **Initial Data Setup**:
Provide instructions if any initial data or database setup is required.

## Usage

Describe the basic usage of the program. For example:

python main.py [OPTIONS]


- Option 1: Description of the option.
- Option 2: Description of the option.
- ...

## Debugging

If `debug_mode` is enabled in the program, you'll receive detailed logs and information on:
- Radar Base Location
- Tornado Location
- X and Y Range for the visual data
- ... (any other debug info)
